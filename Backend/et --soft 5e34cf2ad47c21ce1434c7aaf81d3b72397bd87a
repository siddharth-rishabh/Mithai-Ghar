    test: add failing test cases for authentication and sweets modules
    
    Wrote initial Jest and Supertest test suites covering user registration, login, and sweet management operations as part of the RED phase of TDD. These tests are intentionally failing because the backend implementation is not yet created.

    Added Jest tests for all sweets-related endpoints using TDD.
    These tests currently fail because backend logic is not implemented yet.
